--Tried to implement modular creation of ring of spawners off screen around center planet
--Failed to rearrange equation of a circle properly and ended up spawning a diagonal line
  of spawners through the center of the planet
--Spawner ring creation properly counts how many spawners there should be according
  to the desired radius of the ring, and the horizontal space desired between each
  spawner

--Properly implemented creation of ring of spawners
--Spawners now spawn in a circle, with no duplicates at any of the points
  !@(Previously, the algorithm I used was creating duplicates at the start, and end points
  (left-most and right-most edges of circle), which was unecessary and screwed up spawner
  counter)
  ^^ solved by adding a conditional statement to check if the formula was at one of the
  end points  of the circle
--Circle of spawners can be be altered by adjusting radius of spawner circle, and horizontal
  space in between each spawner
